### <h3 align="center"> *About the Project* </h3>
***
*Collections* consumes the Rick and Morty API to present the User with a list of characters,
it also consumes the Poke API, presenting the User with a list of Pokemons.

The User can save the favorite characters and pokemons from the lists, that is then stored in the *Favorites Page*, from which the User can see or delete them.
